## Overview

MEMORY is an interactive game that times how long it takes users to match pairs of cards. JavaScript lets users flip cards, checks whether the clicked cards match, and then rates the user based on the number of clicks it takes to get them all right.

## Learning Objectives

To use jQuery and utilize event listeners to allow users to flip, match, and shuffle cards.
